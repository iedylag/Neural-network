##Neural Network Implementation Project in R and Python

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! This project was developed as part of my "Machine Learning" course assignment, focusing on implementing neural networks in R and Python.
Project Description

The objective of this project is to compare different implementations of neural networks using popular libraries such as neuralnet in R, scikit-learn in Python, and a self-implemented version without using any libraries. We will also examine sample programs that demonstrate the functionality of these networks, although they are not authored by me.

A crucial aspect of the project is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of neural networks and translate that knowledge into practical implementation. By comparing different libraries and self-implemented approaches, this project provides an opportunity to analyze the performance and flexibility of these tools.
#Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files and folders:

    R/: A folder containing the implementation of neural networks in R using the neuralnet library.
    Python/: A folder containing the implementation of neural networks in Python using the scikit-learn library.
    No-Libraries/: A folder containing self-implemented neural networks without using any libraries.
    Sample-Programs/: A folder containing sample programs illustrating the functionality of neural networks (not authored by me).
    LICENSE: A file containing information about the project's license.
    README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

#Contributions

I would like to emphasize that the sample programs presented in this project are not authored by me. They are used solely for demonstrating the functionality of neural networks.

I have independently implemented neural networks in R and Python and conducted comparisons using the neuralnet and scikit-learn libraries. Additionally, I have implemented neural networks without utilizing any libraries. My goal was to showcase the diverse implementations and provide insights into their performance and flexibility.
